Sam,

Here is another CBT tape contribution.  This utility
allows for edit profile tables to be manipulated. That
is, settings can be changed (STATS, RECOVERY, NULLS,
etc), individual rows (profiles) can be deleted and
settings can be globally propagated into ALL
profiles---kind of like STATS ON ALL.

No rush, the underlying columns will be in the mag in
October/November of this year.
