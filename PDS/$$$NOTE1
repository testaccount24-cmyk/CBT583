Sam,

I'm writing a series of columns on ISPF edit profiles and initial
edit macros. Attached is COBOL source code for an initial edit
macro that I will reference in the article. NaSPA also puts it on
their web site but it takes them forever.

There are comments in the code that explain most everything. The
only thing that should be noted is that the source code has a
PROGRAM-ID of CLCCDYNP but the load member is PROFSET (Profile
Setter).

Check that, the PROGRAM-ID is PROFSET.

Thanks,

Jim

P.S. Note my new email address
