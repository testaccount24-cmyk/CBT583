Sam,

Jim Moore here. I've received a few emails from folks who have
downloaded the "EPROF Utility" (File 583). They all like it but
one of them found a problem that I would like to correct.

It is a "one-line" change (adding a few parameters to an ISPLINK
TBCLOSE call) that literally, adds a single line to the source of
program CLCCEPRF.  What's the best way for me to correct this?

The problem is that unless the ISPF profile DSN is also allocated
to the ISPTABL DD (many sites do this), any edit profile changes
made at the EPROF utility don't "take". This is because TBCLOSE
writes to ISPTABL by default.  The additional parameters I'm
adding point the TBCLOSE to ISPPROF.

Jim
